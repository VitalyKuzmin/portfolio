### Inventory (automation of street lighting data collection and analysis) | [Project Website](https://idc-blg.ru/inventory)  

A software suite created to automate the process of collecting and accounting for data on outdoor lighting assets.

**Problem:**
The inventory business process was entirely manual: data was collected on paper, and third-party contractors were hired to digitize it and plot it on a map, which was slow and expensive.

**Solution:**
I proposed and implemented a comprehensive solution:
- **Android application** for collecting data in the field.
- **Server and 1C database** for centralized information storage.
- **Desktop application (Electron)** for visualizing objects on a map and managing data.
- **Automatic generation of PDF reports** and providing web access to the results for clients.

**Result:**
The solution made it possible to completely eliminate the need for third-party contractors and automate data collection and processing, significantly reducing time and costs.

**My Role:**
I was the key technical specialist on the project, serving as an **analyst, full-stack developer (JS, Node.js, Electron)**, and, over time, **project manager**. I wrote the technical specifications, developed key system components, and managed a small team (designer, tester, 1C developer).
