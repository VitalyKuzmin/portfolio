### Online Calculators (web services for lighting calculation) | [Project Website](https://galad.ru/service/projects/)  

The project was a series of **online services** on the Galad.ru website, designed for calculating various lighting scenarios (road, office, greenhouse, etc.).

**Business Goal:**
To attract new clients to the website and increase conversion into orders for lighting equipment.

**Solution and Results:**
I proposed and implemented a set of online calculators integrated with a personal account. Users could save projects, share them, generate PDF reports, and immediately place orders for the equipment used.
- **Result:** Conversion to orders increased by **20%**.

**Architecture and Stack:**
The backend was implemented in **Python** as services running in **Docker**. **PostgreSQL** was used as the database. Logs were collected in **Elasticsearch/Kibana**.

**My Role:**
- **Tech Lead:** Organized the development process from scratch, hired a Frontend developer, and managed the team (designer, 2 frontend, tester, 1C, PHP, Python).
- **Backend Developer:** Designed and wrote the microservices system.
- **Analyst:** Drew up the technical specifications for development.
