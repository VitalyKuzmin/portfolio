3.  **Technical Leadership:** Managed a team of 10+ people (C++, Python, Frontend, DevOps, QA, Design). Set up log and metric collection using Elasticsearch/Kibana/Grafana. Developed backend modules in Python.
4.  **AI Implementation:** Initiated the use of LLMs to automate UI testing and accelerate development (aider).

**My Role:**
I acted as **Team Lead** and **Product Analyst**. I was responsible for analytics, writing technical specifications, planning, backend development, and overall project management.
