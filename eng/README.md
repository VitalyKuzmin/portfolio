### Key Information

Team Lead with 8+ years in development and over 4 years of experience managing cross-functional teams. For the last 2 years, I have been focused on creating products using LLMs. Deep expertise in Python, designing microservice architectures, and implementing Agile processes (Scrum/Kanban). Successfully built teams from scratch, hired, and developed engineers (from Junior to Senior). I am looking for an opportunity to apply my experience to create AI assistants and contribute to the development of a technological product.

### Work Experience

**Tech Lead**
<br>
*hAi | 2023 - present*

- Designed the architecture and am leading the development of a desktop AI assistant (Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, LiveKit).
- Manage a cross-functional team of 6 people, having established development processes (Scrum, GitHub Projects, DORA).
- Implemented AI agent orchestration, ensuring seamless operation with SOTA models (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Grok) and a local stack (Ollama, whisper.cpp, piper-tts).
- Implemented a secure sandbox for executing AI scripts and validating LLM traffic (Guardrails AI, AST, sys.addaudithook).
- Ensured support for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) standard for flexible extension of the assistant's capabilities.
- Implemented Adaptive RAG using vector databases for deep personalization of responses (SQLite, LanceDB, FastEmbed).
- Built an end-to-end observability system to monitor costs and generation quality (Langfuse, OpenTelemetry, Loki, Prometheus, Grafana).
- Automated quality control and testing: implemented a test pyramid (pytest, Playwright), semantic validation (DeepEval), and static analysis (ruff, pyright).
- Set up CI/CD and secure distribution: automated pipelines and protection for cross-platform builds (GitHub Actions, uv, tox, PyInstaller, Cython).


**Lead Software Engineer / Team Lead**
<br>
*BL-Group (Center for Innovative Development), Moscow | 2021 - 2023*

- Led the development of several products, managing a team of up to 10 people (C++, Python, Frontend, QA, Design, Analytics).
- Organized development processes for the Light in Night Pro project from scratch: implemented Agile methodologies (sprints in Gitlab), set up CI/CD, and hired 5 key specialists.
- Designed and developed a backend in Python (Docker, PostgreSQL) for online calculators, which increased order conversion by 20%.
- Developed an ML system (LightGBM) for planning street lighting reconstruction, which allowed for the automation of tender proposal preparation.
- Initiated and implemented the use of LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT) to automate internal processes (UI testing, content publishing), which significantly accelerated task completion.

**Lead Software Engineer**
<br>
*BL-Group, Moscow | 2018 - 2021*

- Grew from a developer to the project manager of the "Lighting Asset Inventory" project.
- Led a small team (designer, tester, 1C developer), responsible for the full development cycle of the software suite (Android, Electron, JS, Node.js).
- Proposed and implemented a solution that fully automated a key business process, eliminating dependence on third-party contractors and manual labor.
